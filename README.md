Hola Peeps!

Limitless-vistas here, question, is the Grande Toasted Breakfast Burrito with steak any good for breakfast at taco bell? Best way to describe myself. Tacos on the moon? I feel like I would trip on something before taking a bite and drop the taco, then with no gravity, there floats the taco. haha.
